The image recognition and classification of mammal and reptile class using deep learning project is designed using CNN and RNN. 
The CNN model is MobileNetV2 while the RNN model is Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) using the encoder and decoder approach.
Images considered are Zebras, cats, dogs, snakes and turtles. These images are gotten from Kaggle and redefined to meet the specific need. A total of 5,000 images with 1,000 from each class is used to train the model.
